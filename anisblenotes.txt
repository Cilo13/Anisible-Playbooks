Ansible notes


add ssh keys (musy have been named in the /etc/hosts file)

ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/open servera.example.com

then ping them,

ansible -m ping all


gather facts*

ansible web -m setup

ansible (servername) -m (noidea) command


install a package

ansible web -b -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present"

ansible (servername) -m(command to run on system) yum() service name and version

-f (threads)
-m (module to use)

-a (no idea but most basic apparrently )


(not ansible but nice way to check its installed)

ssh servera.example.com "rpm -qa | grep httpd-[0-9]*"



start a service we istalled

ansible web -b -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"

and then verifi using ssh again

ssh servera.example.com "systemctl status httpd"

That was just command to run and then quit


now for a play book


Create a site.yml file containing the playbook

so vi *playbook.yml

(complete playbook)

---
- hosts: web
  name: Install the web server and start it
  become: yes
  vars:
    httpd_packages:
      - httpd
      - mod_wsgi
    apache_test_message: This is a test message
    apache_max_keep_alive_requests: 115

  tasks:
    - name: Install the apache web server
      yum:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      with_items: "{{ httpd_packages }}"
      notify: restart apache service

    - name: Generate apache's configuration file from jinja2 template
      template:
        src: templates/httpd.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
      notify: restart apache service

    - name: Generate a basic homepage from jinja2 template
      template:
        src: templates/index.html.j2
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html

    - name: Start the apache web server
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes

  handlers:
    - name: restart apache service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
        enabled: yes




  create a folder called templates to create template config files which will let you move them into other servers and automate setup
  even more.
